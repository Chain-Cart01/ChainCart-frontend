# ChainCart on Xion Blockchain

## Overview

Our platform revolutionizes real estate transactions by creating a decentralized marketplace for landed property, powered by AI using the Xion blockchain ecosystem. The platform functions similarly to traditional e-commerce applications but with several key blockchain-enabled advantages:

- **Trustless Transactions**: Buyers and sellers interact through smart contracts rather than requiring third-party intermediaries
- **Tokenized Payments**: Properties are purchased using Xion, a Xion ecosystem token
- **Escrow Protection**: A custom CosmWasm smart contract safeguards funds until transaction completion
- **Wallet Authentication**: Users authenticate using their meta accounts, eliminating the need for traditional account creation
- **Interoperability**: Built on Xion, enabling future cross-chain functionality with other blockchain networks
- **AI Agent**

## Overview

Our platform revolutionizes real estate transactions by creating a decentralized marketplace for landed property, powered by the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. The platform functions similarly to traditional e-commerce applications but with several key blockchain-enabled advantages:

- **Trustless Transactions**: Buyers and sellers interact through smart contracts rather than requiring third-party intermediaries
- **Tokenized Payments**: Properties are purchased using Neutron, a Cosmos ecosystem token
- **Escrow Protection**: A custom CosmWasm smart contract safeguards funds until transaction completion
- **Wallet Authentication**: Users authenticate using their crypto wallets, eliminating the need for traditional account creation
- **Interoperability**: Built on Cosmos, enabling future cross-chain functionality with other blockchain networks

This platform addresses major pain points in traditional real estate transactions: high intermediary fees, lengthy processing times, limited payment options, and vulnerability to fraud. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a more efficient, transparent, and secure process for buying and selling landed property.
